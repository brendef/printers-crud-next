Home Screen Where All  Are Displayed:

The home screen contains the search bar that searches for the  by name and displays them only. 

The home screen also contains a toggle button that allows a user to only show active or inactive . There is a dedicated checkbox that can be used to enable and disable this feature. 

The home screen is responsive and looks great on mobile.

## FAQ

#### Why does this not work over SSL/HTTPS

I just need to install an SSL Certificate and configure nginx or apache then it should be good to go.

#### Why Next 13

Next is my favourite Framework. I used next 13 because I was looking for a good reason to try out the new features. 

#### Why AWS EC2

My goal was to get something up and running ASAP. EC2s are super simple make a perfect dev environmnet. I do belive a serverless product such as *Amplify* for the front end and *lambda* would have been better. I will migrate this later one to use these technologies for sure!

## How can this project be improved

There are so many way this project could be improved. Here are four cool features that could still be implemented:
1. Automatically detect  on a newtwork and display them on screen
2. Show or Hide , instead of deleting them from the database
3. Show printer activity in addition and other information to state. (eg. "printing" or "low on ink")
4. Display success and failure messages on the screen. This is for the user to have more information about what is going on.
